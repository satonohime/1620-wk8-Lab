            Hi, I'm Ryan. I've lived in Coquitlam for my whole life. I attended SFU and UBC in the past but at times I felt that I didn't enjoy what I was studying
            and if there were subjects I was interested in, they didn't seem like good career choices to pursue. Because of that, I enrolled in the CIT program in hopes 
            that I can get a good job in the future. I'm not sure what I want to do specifically, but I really like what I've been doing in this course so far.
        </p>

        <p>Here are a list of my hobbies in no particular order (I enjoy them all equally), but I need to use an ordered list for the lab:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Video games, 2d fighting games and rhythm games in particular</li>
            <li>Art, although I hardly have time to get good at it because of school</li>
            <li>Japanese media, anything from novels to anime and music</li>
        </ol>
